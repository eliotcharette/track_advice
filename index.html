      <p>The language the best suits you is: <strong>JavaScript!</strong> <br> JavaScript is an extremely popular and in demand programming language. It's faster and simpler than most programming languages making it also one of the easiest to learn; though there can be some downsides on the user end as it is interpreted differently on different browsers. Overall it's a great first language to learn for almost any kind of programmer.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="csharp" class="">
      <img src="img/csharp.png" height="250px" alt="">
      <p>The language the best suits you is: <strong>C#!</strong> <br>C# is one of the more difficult programming languages but once you learn it, a lot of the knowledge is transferrable to other languages. It also has a popularity and demand in jobs. This would be a great first language for you if you don't mind working a bit harder for a great base language.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="ruby" class="">
     <img src="img/ruby.png" height="200px" alt="">
     <p>The language the best suits you is: <strong>Ruby!</strong> <br>Ruby is one of the easiest and most dynamic programming languages to learn. It has a huge community with tons of great resources and tools, though even its staunches supports will admit it is slower than most languages and its popularity is waning. This would be a great first language for anyone who wants to pick up their first language relatively easily.</p>
